Hello, World

### Collaborative Literature Reviews
Inspired by [Jonathan Haidt](https://jonathanhaidt.com/reviews), I run collaborative review documents for topics
in computer science and mathematics. Here you can share scientific papers, preprints, news articles, GitHub repositories,
YouTube videos, and other resources. Please contribute!
